# Hello3DWorld
As the name suggests this is my very first 3D game in Unity. My very first project in Unity to be more specific. My goal is to self teach programming using C# and this is a fun way to do so. I know the project is the opposite of perfect, and I don't expect anyone to read anything but why not learn github at the same time?
